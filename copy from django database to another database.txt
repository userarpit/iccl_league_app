1️⃣ Using Django Fixtures (Recommended)

Django allows you to export and import data as JSON, YAML, or XML.

Step A: Export initial data (if from SQLite or existing DB)
	
		python manage.py dumpdata > initial_data.json


This creates a JSON file with your models’ data.

You can filter specific apps:

		python manage.py dumpdata myapp > myapp_initial_data.json

Step B: Load data into PostgreSQL

After your containers are running and migrations are done:

docker compose exec web python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
